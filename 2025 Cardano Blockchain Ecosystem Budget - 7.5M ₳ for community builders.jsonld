    "comment": "As a DRep, I am casting a **YES** vote for the **2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Info Action** (Governance Action ID: `gov_action1mmalzkcxpyn33t05hml2hxpwq0ffv6uu4mhe8sv7guz5nmm4afysqlmepzl`). \nBelow is my rationale:\n\n\n### ✅ Rationale for YES Vote\n\n#### 1. **Constitutional Integrity and Threshold Correction**\n\nThis Info Action directly addresses a critical flaw observed in the initial budget process—namely, the misapplication of the **50% + 1 Lovelace threshold**. By recalibrating the threshold against the **active voting stake (5.38B ADA)** rather than overall participation, the proposers restore democratic legitimacy and prevent governance distortion. Only proposals that met the corrected threshold of **2.69B ADA** are included, ensuring majority support and adherence to the **Cardano Constitution’s Article IV**.\n\n\n#### 2. **Empowering Community Builders**\n\nA core purpose of this action is to **lower barriers to entry** for builders and innovators who do not have the 100k ADA deposit required for individual proposal submission. By bundling proposals that surpassed quorum into a collective Info Action, this mechanism enables **grassroots participation** without compromising on quality or support levels. It’s a practical step toward a **more inclusive and decentralized treasury system**.\n\n\n#### 3. **Exclusion of Founding Entities for Fairness**\n\nThe deliberate exclusion of proposals from founding entities (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo), even when they met the threshold, reinforces neutrality and safeguards against **institutional bias**. It sends a strong signal that **no actor is above the process** and that **community-driven proposals** are prioritized within the Net Change Limit (₳350M), in line with constitutional expectations.\n\n\n#### 4. **Clear Alignment with the Net Change Limit (NCL)**\n\nThe combined allocation of ₳7.56M remains well within the ₳350M cap for 2025. The budgeting is **fiscally responsible**, respects **long-term treasury sustainability**, and enables strategic experimentation (e.g., Layer 2 solutions, wallet infrastructure, node performance) without risking overspending.\n\n\n#### 5. **Transparent and Structured Process**\n\nThe entire process—from open submission to off-chain signaling (Ekklesia) to this on-chain Info Action—was handled with a high degree of transparency and community engagement. Proposals were **standardized**, **vetted**, and **backed by data**. This demonstrates maturity in Cardano's evolving governance and strengthens community trust.\n\n\n#### 6. **Real-World Relevance and Ecosystem Impact**\n\nThe proposals funded—such as **zkFold**, **Midgard Optimistic Rollups**, **Blockfrost Platform**, and **Hardware Wallet Maintenance**—align with Cardano’s roadmap in scaling, developer tooling, and security. They represent **tangible progress** in areas where Cardano must remain competitive and developer-friendly.\n\n\n### ✅ Summary\n\nThis Info Action exemplifies **constitutional governance in action**—respecting thresholds, protecting the treasury, and empowering builders. It corrects past procedural missteps without disenfranchising the community. By voting **YES**, I support a **transparent, inclusive, and legitimate budgeting process** that aligns with the vision of Voltaire and the values embedded in the Cardano Constitution.\n\n\n*Omid | Cardano DRep*\n*“Legitimacy through participation, sustainability through restraint.”*\n"
