    "motivations": "With a Master’s degree in Software Engineering and over 12 years of experience as a Software Architect and Technical Product Manager, I bring both technical expertise and strategic vision to the Cardano ecosystem. Since 2017, I have been an active member of the Cardano community, gaining in-depth knowledge of its architecture and governance mechanisms.\n\nCurrently, I am leading the GovCircle Project, which goes beyond CIP-1694 by addressing gaps in communication and collaboration within Cardano’s governance framework. Additionally, I am very active in the Iranian blockchain community and will serve as a hub for Persians to communicate and engage in Cardano governance. My motivation as a DRep is to foster an ecosystem where informed decision-making, community engagement, and governance transparency drive sustainable growth.",
    "objectives": "I believe in a decentralized world where governance is distributed among technically skilled and talented individuals. My goal as a DRep is to contribute to a governance system that values expertise, transparency, and meaningful participation. I aim to ensure that governance decisions are informed, technically sound, and aligned with the long-term vision of Cardano’s ecosystem. Additionally, one of my key objectives is to bridge the Persian community to Cardano governance, fostering greater participation and engagement from Persian-speaking stakeholders.",
